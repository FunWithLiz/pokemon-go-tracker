## Pokemon-Go-Tracker

The primary goal for the Pokemon-Go-Tracker is to track the Pokemon you already have and build teams using the Pokemon you caught or would like to catch and use in your team.

## Technical Discussion
### HTML
HTML was part of the EJS I've incorporated in my code.
### CSS
I used simple CSS styling. I wished I had more time to stylize my app.
### JavaScript
Initially used Javasript to incorporate an API (https://pokeapi.co/) to pass information to my database. Other Javascripts can be found through my EJS.

## Initial thoughts

Some things that I've encountered in my app:

1. CRUD
=> I struggled to finish my CRUD and get it up and running. This is by far the hardest and longest obstacle I had to go through. Luckily, my classmates (especially Bo) helped me with my API function in my seed.js file and also helped me look over my code for stray or missing syntax.

2. Having users, pokemon_types and types table.
=> Initally I wanted to have a couple of tables and join them to fulfill the JOIN REQUIREMENT from the evaluation rubric. Well, I bit off more than I can chew, so I wasn't able to join any of the tables at all. 

3. I wanted to incorporate AUTH in my code.
=> This was a major oversight on my side as I did not know the challenge I would face with getting CRUD up and running. Unfortunately, I was not able to set-up a user log-in/password function in this app but I would very much like to try to tackle it in my next.

4. Stylizing my app.
=> Based on my wireframes, I wanted to move forward with a simple design because I knew realistically, I wasn't able to complete the functionality of my app and have time to stylize my app the way I wanted to.

## Phases of Completion

1. Complete wireframes
2. Coding
  a. Set-up the server and have it running and connected
  b. Creating the database: Schema.SQL/Seed.js and Seed.SQL
  c. Completing the funcionality of the models and Controllers where CRUD lies...
  d. Routing 
  e. Develop the EJS files
  f. Stylize the pages

## Due Credit

#### Bo Lee
=> API function

=> Helped check my code (especially in my models, to see if the syntax is correct/missing)

#### Christopher Lin
=> Update function

## Opportunities for Growth
I wish I could have moved forward and finished CRUD earlier so I'm able to attempt using AUTH within my code. I also did not have time to stylize the page, JOIN tables, add more tabs such as the Pokemon Resource sections and add images for each Pokemon I had on the list. This was by far the hardest thing I had to create up to this point. I hope this will come easy as time passes.
